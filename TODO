Documentation
=============

The reference manual needs completion.  In particular, there is a list of items
which need documentation at the end of reference.rst

Add documentation for request object, including POST handling and decorators.

Tests
=====

MethodSwitch.  Particularly in the presence of decorators on the switched
methods.


If there is a handler for post data, does Request.params get set?  It should be
set to containg the query string parameters, I think.  Perhaps.

Don't include simplejson by default in postdata.py

Fixes
=====

Set jsonreturning and jsonpreturning mime-types appropriately.
